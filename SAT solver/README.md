To do:
* Run each level of difficulty * each heuristic
* Come up with script for analysis


Analysis
- test the relative level of performance of each of the heuristics
- across each of the levels of difficulty
- level of performance is:
Being good at finding the correct path: few number of backtracks
Getting to the solution quickly: small number of guesses
